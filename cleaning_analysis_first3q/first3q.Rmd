Questions 

The whole system: from whatâ€™s coming through the front door in A&E and then how it filters through; how many emergency admissions are there, how many electives, how does this impact the lengths of stay people have in hospital?

What does this mean for the number of people in intensive care and the number of beds?

Do people have longer lengths of stay from elective or emergency admissions?

```{r}

# for the app: 

# show A&E Attendances, Hospital Activity or Bed Occupancy 

# 2. for A&E attendances: 

        # 1. select: yearly or seasonal comparison 
        # 2. select: number of attendances or number meeting target. 
    
# 3. For Hospital Activity: 
   # select: whole period, years before pandemic, years during pandemic, seasons(years 2020-21), seasonal variation before pandemic.
   # select: type of patient: elective or emergency. 
   # select: number of episodes or length of stay: 
   # select: Intensive Care or Other departments
  

# For Bed Occupancy 

# select: whole period, years before pandemic, years during pandemic, or seasons (2020-21), seasons(before pandemic). 
# select: Intensive Care or Other departments
# select: total occupancy or percentage of all bed availability.
